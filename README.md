2. [Move to Safety] - Defensive repositioning away from threats
3. [Dodge Action] - Focus on survival over offense
```

**Deadly Difficulty Response:**
```
1. [Multi-attack Weakest PC] - Eliminate the unconscious rogue to force death saves
2. [Legendary Action Movement] - Position for flanking and opportunity attacks
3. [Counterspell] - Ready action to counter the wizard's next spell
```

## Troubleshooting
